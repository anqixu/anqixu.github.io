# About Me

**Email**: *anqi (dot) xu (at) mail (period) mcgill (point) ca*

Hi there! I am a Research Scientist at [Element AI](https://www.elementai.com/).
I'm passionate about building adaptive AI and robotic systems to enhance our everyday workflow.
Some of my research interests include interactive machine learning, computational mobile robotics, computer and robotic vision, and human-robot interaction.

I am an allumnus member of the [Mobile Robotics Lab](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~mrl/), at the [Centre for Intelligent Machines](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/) and the [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/), at [McGill University](https://mcgill.ca/).
My supervisor is [Professor Gregory Dudek](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~dudek/), whom I have worked with since my undergraduate days at McGill.
My Ph.D., granted in 2017, focused on maintaining and improving the efficiency of human-robot teams by building trust in the relationship.
I'm proud to be a [Vanier CGS scholar](https://vanier.gc.ca/).
