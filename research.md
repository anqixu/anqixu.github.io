We are interested in optimizing both the task performance and efficiency of interaction in a human-robot system.
To achieve these objectives, we are developing a computational model that characterizes a human operator's degree of trust in an autonomous robotic system.
This quantitative measure shares properties with analogous concepts of trust among humans in sociology and psychology.
Given the need to build trust within the human-robot team, we are also investigating trust-seeking adaptive strategies for increasing the team's efficiency, in terms of the robot's task performance and the human's workload and satisfaction.

## Interactive Autonomy for Visual Navigation

As robots become more intelligent and autonomous, a critical emerging research topic is how humans can interact and command these robots.
Towards this end, we are developing efficient human-robot interaction methodologies, as well as learning algorithms targeting different levels of specificity within the robot's autonomous system.
A primary application domain for this research is vision-based robot navigation, for which complicated robot sensing and control algorithms can benefit a lot from the keen instincts of human visual system.
